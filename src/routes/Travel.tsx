            Redmond is located just east of Seattle and is known for its
            beautiful parks, access to nature, and accessible food options to
            Seattle and surrounding cities (Bellevue, Kirkland, Woodinville). We
            hope that you'd take this opportunity to explore the area while
            you're here since it is some of the best times of the year to visit!

                  We recommend renting a car for convenience, but rideshare
                  services are also available. Rideshares are common to the
                  airport and local areas near your accommodations, but if
                  you're interested in visiting Seattle, crossing the lake can
                  cost a premium and makes it less practical than renting a car.
