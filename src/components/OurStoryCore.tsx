        <span className="font-bold text-3xl">Lynh & Michael</span> both happened
        to be in Washington interning for the same company one summer. During
        orientation, interns were seated by table of the organization they'd be
        working for‚Äîand that's how Michael ended up next to Lynh. They exchanged
        a few words but didn't think much of it at the time. From what they
        remember, Lynh joked, ‚ÄúIf you're from Staten Island, are you related to
        Pete Davidson?‚Äù while Michael asked if Lynh's house in Minnesota looked
        like an igloo.

        <p className="text-xl my-4">
          In the evenings, the people staying at the hotel would often gather in
          the lobby to hang out and play games. One night, someone suggested
          poker‚Äîone of Lynh's favorite games. Michael had never played before,
          so Lynh offered to teach him‚Ä¶ but not for free.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl my-4">
          With no poker chips, they resorted to verbal bets. Michael's first
          loss earned Lynh a week of rides to work (he had taken the rental car
          option while Lynh took the transportation stipend option). That ‚Äúweek‚Äù
          quickly turned into the rest of the summer.

          Michael, ever proud of his air fryer purchase from Costco, boasted
          about using it to survive hotel living. So when he lost another hand,
          he upped the ante: he'd cook Lynh dinner. Skeptical‚Äîbut also
          hungry‚ÄîLynh eventually took him up on the offer.

        <p className="text-xl my-4">
          Michael made a surprisingly good air fryer chicken dinner, and over
          dinner, they played another round of poker‚Äîjust the two of them this
          time. After yet another loss, Michael decided to raise the stakes: ‚ÄúIf
          I win the next hand, I get to take you out on a{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">proper date.</span>‚Äù Given his track
          record, Lynh didn't worry.
